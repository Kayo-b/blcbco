    "ourStory": "About",
    "paragraph1": "Everything begins with the privilege of being Brazilian with the strength and resilience of a land defined by contrasts, exuberance, and contradiction. A country that fills the heart with pride because, even in the face of loss and challenge, we always find a way to welcome others. Leaving home is never easy.",
    "paragraph2": "Through every challenge and lesson, one thing has always stayed with me: love expressed through food. It was in each meal that I learned my mother's quiet strength and boundless care. Food has that power it brings us home, no matter how far we've gone.",
    "paragraph3": "When I cook, I find joy and purpose. Everything else fades into silence. Cooking is how I turn everyday life into magic it's what brought me out of dark places and back to life.",
    "paragraph4": "I didn't get here alone. It took many hands, many gestures of kindness, many stories intertwined with mine. That's why I dedicate myself to giving back spreading love and belonging through what I create. I believe simplicity is the essence of happiness, and from it comes my desire to share the warmth of a Brazilian backyard: the flavors, the gatherings, and the quiet beauty of the simple things that make our land so unique."
